# Simon-game
A memory game 

You have to memorize the colors:

For example:

Level 1: red

Level 2: red, green

Level 3: red, green, red

Level 4: red, green, red, yellow

The sequence will be: red, green, red, yellow, and so on and so forth

The game requires the user to repeat the sequence of colors.

If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer. 

Once the user fails the game is over.
